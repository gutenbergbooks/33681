<h2>NOTE</h2>


<p>This collection of War Poems, the net profits
from which will be given to the Prince of
Wales's Fund, represents the free offering of English
poets to the cause of National Relief.</p>

<p>Most of the poems have appeared recently in the
Press. Mr. Robert Bridges' opening contribution,
Mr. Henry Newbolt's, Mr. Maurice Hewlett's,
Mr. R. E. Vernède's, Mr. Binyon's, were all printed
in the <i>Times</i> during the few days immediately
following the declaration of war, as also was the
sonnet by Mr. William Watson. Sir Owen Seaman's
poem came out originally in <i>Punch</i>, "The Hour"
in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, "The United Front" in the
<i>Daily Mail</i>. "We Willed it Not" is reprinted from
the <i>Sphere</i>, "Duty" and "Commandeered" from the
<i>Westminster Gazette</i>, and the poems by Mr. Gilbert
and Mr. Cecil Chesterton from the <i>New Witness</i>.
The <i>New Weekly</i> published the verses by Mr. John
Freeman, and the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> those by Mr.
Harold Begbie. The two hymns which close the
collection are reprinted, by special permission of
their authors, from volumes previously published.</p>

<p>The publishers desire also to record their thanks
to Mr. William Nicholson for the design which
appears on the cover.</p>

<h2>"WAKE UP, ENGLAND"</h2>

<p>
Thou careless, awake!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou peacemaker, fight!</span><br />
Stand, England, for honour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And God guard the Right!</span><br />
<br />
Thy mirth lay aside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy cavil and play:</span><br />
The foe is upon thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And grave is the day.</span><br />
<br />
The monarch Ambition<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath harnessed his slaves;</span><br />
But the folk of the Ocean<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are free as the waves.</span><br />
<br />
For Peace thou art armed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy Freedom to hold:</span><br />
Thy Courage as iron,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy Good-faith as gold.</span><br />
<br />
Through Fire, Air, and Water<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy trial must be:</span><br />
But they that love life best<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Die gladly for thee.</span><br />
<br />
The Love of their mothers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is strong to command;</span><br />
The fame of their fathers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is might to their hand.</span><br />
<br />
Much suffering shall cleanse thee;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But thou through the flood</span><br />
Shalt win to Salvation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Beauty through blood.</span><br />
<br /></p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><br /><br />
Up, careless, awake!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ye peacemakers, fight!</span><br />
<span class="smcap">England stands for Honour:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;" class="smcap">God defend the Right!</span><br />

<h2>THE VIGIL</h2>


<p>
England! where the sacred flame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Burns before the inmost shrine,</span><br />
Where the lips that love thy name<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Consecrate their hopes and thine,</span><br />
Where the banners of thy dead<br />
Weave their shadows overhead,<br />
Watch beside thine arms to-night,<br />
Pray that God defend the Right.<br />
<br />
Think that when to-morrow comes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">War shall claim command of all,</span><br />
Thou must hear the roll of drums,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou must hear the trumpet's call.</span><br />
Now before they silence ruth,<br />
Commune with the voice of truth;<br />
England! on thy knees to-night<br />
Pray that God defend the Right.<br />
<br />
Single-hearted, unafraid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hither all thy heroes came,</span><br />
On this altar's steps were laid<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gordon's life and Outram's fame.</span><br />
England! if thy will be yet<br />
By their great example set,<br />
Here beside thine arms to-night<br />
Pray that God defend the Right.<br />
<br />
So shalt thou when morning comes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rise to conquer or to fall,</span><br />
Joyful hear the rolling drums,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Joyful hear the trumpet's call.</span><br />
Then let memory tell thy heart;<br />
"<i>England! what thou wert, thou art!</i>"<br />
Gird thee with thine ancient might,<br />
Forth! and God defend the Right!<br />

<h2>TO THE TROUBLER OF THE WORLD</h2>


<p>
At last we know you, War-lord. You, that flung<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gauntlet down, fling down the mask you wore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Publish your heart, and let its pent hate pour,</span><br />
You that had God for ever on your tongue.<br />
We are old in war, and if in guile we are young,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Young also is the spirit that evermore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Burns in our bosom ev'n as heretofore,</span><br />
Nor are these thews unbraced, these nerves unstrung.<br />
We do not with God's name make wanton play;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We are not on such easy terms with Heaven;</span><br />
But in Earth's hearing we can verily say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Our hands are pure; for peace, for peace we have striven";</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not by Earth shall he be soon forgiven</span><br />
Who lit the fire accurst that flames to-day.<br />

<h2>TO ENGLAND: TO STRIKE QUICKLY</h2>


<p>
Fight, since thou must; strike quick and fierce,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So when this tyrant for too long</span><br />
Hath shook the blood out of his ears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He may have learned the price of wrong.</span><br />
<br />
Let him learn this, that the due grief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his own vice he cannot ban</span><br />
By outrage of a highway thief;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let him remember the Corsican,</span><br />
<br />
Whom England only durst not dread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By sea or shore, but faced alone,</span><br />
Nor stayed for pity of her dead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until the despot's day was done.</span><br />
<br />
Strike, England, quickly, make an end<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of him who seeks a deal with thee.</span><br />
If he would bargain for thy friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What would he trade for Liberty?</span><br />

<h2>THE FOURTH OF AUGUST</h2>


<p>
Now in thy splendour go before us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spirit of England, ardent-eyed!</span><br />
Enkindle this dear earth that bore us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the hour of peril purified.</span><br />
<br />
The cares we hugged drop out of vision,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our hearts with deeper thoughts dilate.</span><br />
We step from days of sour division<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into the grandeur of our fate.</span><br />
<br />
For us the glorious dead have striven;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They battled that we might be free.</span><br />
We to that living cause are given,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We arm for men that are to be.</span><br />
<br />
Among the nations nobliest chartered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">England recalls her heritage.</span><br />
With her is that which is not bartered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which force can neither quell nor cage.</span><br />
<br />
For her immortal stars are burning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With her, the hope that's never done,</span><br />
The seed that's in the Spring's returning,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The very flower that seeks the sun.</span><br />
<br />
We fight the fraud that feeds desire on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lies, in a lust to enslave or kill,</span><br />
The barren creed of blood and iron,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vampire of Europe's wasted will.</span><br />
<br />
Endure, O Earth! and thou, awaken,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Purged by this dreadful winnowing-fan,</span><br />
O wronged, untameable, unshaken<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soul of divinely suffering man!</span><br />

<h2>THE UNITED FRONT</h2>


<p style="margin-left: 8em;">I.</p>

<p>
Thus only should it come, if come it must;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not with a riot of flags or a mob-born cry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But with a noble faith, a conscience high</span><br />
And pure and proud as heaven, wherein we trust,<br />
We who have fought for peace, have dared the thrust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of calumny for peace, and watched her die,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her scutcheons rent from sky to outraged sky</span><br />
By felon hands, and trampled into the dust.<br />
<br />
We fought for peace, and we have seen the law<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cancelled, not once, nor twice, by felon hands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But shattered, again, again, and yet again.</span><br />
We fought for peace. Now, in God's name, we draw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sword, not with a riot of flags and bands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But silence, and a mustering of men.</span><br />
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 8em;">II.</p>

<p>
They challenge Truth. An Empire makes reply.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One faith, one flag, one honour, and one might.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From sea to sea, from height to war-worn height,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>The old word rings out&mdash;to conquer, or to die.<br />
And we shall conquer. Though their eagles fly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through heaven, around this ancient isle unite</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Powers that were never vanquished in the fight,</span><br />
The unconquerable Powers that cannot lie.<br />
<br />
But they who challenge Truth, Law, Justice, all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bases on which God and man stand sure</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Throughout all ages, fools!&mdash;they thought us torn</span><br />
So far with discord that the blow might fall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unanswered; and, while all those Powers endure,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This is our answer: Unity and Scorn.</span><br />
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 8em;">III.</p>

<p>
We trust not in the multitude of an host.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nations that greatly builded, greatly stand.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In those dark hours, the Splendour of a Hand</span><br />
Has moved behind the darkness, till that coast<br />
Where hate and faction seemed to triumph most<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reveals itself&mdash;a buckler and a brand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our rough-hewn work, shining o'er sea and land,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>But shaped to nobler ends than man could boast.<br />
<br />
It is God's answer. Though, for many a year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This land forgot the faith that made her great,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now, as her fleets cast off the North Sea foam,</span><br />
Casting aside all faction and all fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thrice-armed in all the majesty of her fate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Britain remembers, and her sword strikes home.</span><br />

<h2>ENGLAND TO THE SEA</h2>


<p>
Hearken, O Mother, hearken to thy daughter!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fain would I tell thee what men tell to me,</span><br />
Saying that henceforth no more on any water<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall I be first or great or loved or free,</span><br />
<br />
But that these others&mdash;so the tale is spoken&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who have not known thee all these centuries</span><br />
By fire and sword shall yet turn England broken<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Back from thy breast and beaten from thy seas,</span><br />
<br />
Me&mdash;whom thou barest where thy waves should guard me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Me&mdash;whom thou suckled'st on thy milk of foam,</span><br />
Me&mdash;whom thy kisses shaped what while they marred me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To whom thy storms are sweet and ring of home.</span><br />
<br />
"Behold," they cry, "she is grown soft and strengthless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All her proud memories changed to fear and fret."</span><br />
Say, thou, who hast watched through ages that are lengthless,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom have I feared, and when did I forget?</span><br />
<br />
What sons of mine have shunned thy whorls and races?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have I not reared for thee time and again</span><br />
And bid go forth to share thy fierce embraces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sea-ducks, sea-wolves, sea-rovers, and sea-men?</span><br />
<br />
Names that thou knowest&mdash;great hearts that thou holdest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rocking them, rocking them in an endless wake&mdash;</span><br />
Captains the world can match not with its boldest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hawke, Howard, Grenville, Frobisher, Drake?</span><br />
<br />
Nelson&mdash;the greatest of them all&mdash;the master<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who swept across thee like a shooting star,</span><br />
And, while the Earth stood veiled before disaster,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Caught Death and slew him&mdash;there&mdash;at Trafalgar?</span><br />
<br />
Mother, they knew me then as thou didst know me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then I cried, Peace, and every flag was furled:</span><br />
But I am old, it seems, and they would show me<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">That never more my peace shall bind the world.</span><br />
<br />
Wherefore, O Sea, I, standing thus before thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stretch forth my hands unto thy surge and say:</span><br />
"When they come forth who seek this empire o'er thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I go forth to meet them&mdash;on that day</span><br />
<br />
"God grant to us the old Armada weather,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The winds that rip, the heavens that stoop and lour&mdash;</span><br />
Not till the Sea and England sink together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall they be masters! Let them boast that hour!"</span><br />

<h2>THE HOUR</h2>


<p>
We've shut the gates by Dover Straits,<br />
And North, where the tides run free,<br />
Cheek by jowl, our watchdogs prowl,<br />
Grey hulks in a greyer sea.<br />
And the prayer that England prays to-night&mdash;<br />
O Lord of our destiny!&mdash;<br />
As the foam of our plunging prows, is white;<br />
We have stood for peace, and we war for right,<br />
God give us victory!<br />
<br />
Now slack, now strung, from the mainmast flung,<br />
The flag throbs fast in the breeze;<br />
Strained o'er the foam, like the hearts at home<br />
That beat for their sons on the seas.<br />
For mothers and wives are praying to-night&mdash;<br />
O Lord of our destiny!&mdash;<br />
But we've no time, for our lips are tight,<br />
Our fists are clenched, and we're stripped to fight.<br />
God give us victory!<br />
<br />
The west winds blow in the face of the foe&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Old Drake is beating his drum&mdash;<br />
They drank to "The Day," for "The Hour" we pray.<br />
The day and the hour have come.<br />
The sea-strewn Empire prays to-night&mdash;<br />
O Lord of our destiny!&mdash;<br />
Thou didst give the seas into Britain's might,<br />
For the freedom of Thy seas we smite.<br />
God give us victory!<br />

<h2>THE WIFE OF FLANDERS</h2>


<p>
Low and brown barns, thatched and repatched and tattered,<br />
Where I had seven sons until to-day&mdash;<br />
A little hill of hay your spur has scattered....<br />
This is not Paris. You have lost the way.<br />
<br />
You, staring at your sword to find it brittle,<br />
Surprised at the surprise that was your plan,<br />
Who shaking and breaking barriers not a little,<br />
Find never more the death-door of Sedan.<br />
<br />
Must I for more than carnage call you claimant,<br />
Paying you a penny for each son you slay?<br />
Man, the whole globe in gold were no repayment<br />
For what you have lost. And how shall I repay?<br />
<br />
What is the price of that red spark that caught me<br />
From a kind farm that never had a name?<br />
What is the price of that dead man they brought me?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>For other dead men do not look the same.<br />
<br />
How should I pay for one poor graven steeple<br />
Whereon you shattered what you shall not know?<br />
How should I pay you, miserable people,<br />
How should I pay you everything you owe?<br />
<br />
Unhappy, can I give you back your honour?<br />
Though I forgave, would any man forget?<br />
While all the great green land has trampled on her<br />
The treason and terror of the night we met.<br />
<br />
Not any more in vengeance or in pardon,<br />
One old wife bargains for a bean that's hers.<br />
You have no word to break: no heart to harden.<br />
Ride on and prosper. You have lost your spurs.<br />

<h2>THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES</h2>


<p>
And now, while the dark vast earth shakes and rocks<br />
In this wild dreamlike snare of mortal shocks,<br />
How look (I muse) those cold and solitary stars<br />
On these magnificent, cruel wars?&mdash;<br />
Venus, that brushes with her shining lips<br />
(Surely!) the wakeful edge of the world and mocks<br />
With hers its all ungentle wantonness?&mdash;<br />
Or the large moon (pricked by the spars of ships<br />
Creeping and creeping in their restlessness),<br />
The moon pouring strange light on things more strange,<br />
Looks she unheedfully on seas and lands<br />
Trembling with change and fear of counterchange?<br />
<br />
O, not earth trembles, but the stars, the stars!<br />
The sky is shaken and the cool air is quivering.<br />
I cannot look up to the crowded height<br />
And see the fair stars trembling in their light,<br />
For thinking of the starlike spirits of men<br />
Crowding the earth and with great passion quivering:&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Stars quenched in anger and hate, stars sick with pity.<br />
I cannot look up to the naked skies<br />
Because a sorrow on dark midnight lies,<br />
Death, on the living world of sense;<br />
Because on my own land a shadow lies<br />
That may not rise;<br />
Because from bare grey hillside and rich city<br />
Streams of uncomprehending sadness pour,<br />
Thwarting the eager spirit's pure intelligence....<br />
How look (I muse) those cold and solitary stars<br />
On these magnificent, cruel wars?<br />
<br />
Stars trembled in broad heaven, faint with pity.<br />
An hour to dawn I looked. Beside the trees<br />
Wet mist shaped other trees that branching rose,<br />
Covering the woods and putting out the stars.<br />
There was no murmur on the seas,<br />
No wind blew&mdash;only the wandering air that grows<br />
With dawn, then murmurs, sighs,<br />
And dies.<br />
The mist climbed slowly, putting out the stars,<br />
And the earth trembled when the stars were gone;<br />
And moving strangely everywhere upon<br />
The trembling earth, thickened the watery mist.<br />
<br />
And for a time the holy things are veiled.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>England's wise thoughts are swords; her quiet hours<br />
Are trodden underfoot like wayside flowers,<br />
And every English heart is England's wholly.<br />
In starless night<br />
A serious passion streams the heaven with light.<br />
A common beating is in the air&mdash;<br />
The heart of England throbbing everywhere.<br />
And all her roads are nerves of noble thought,<br />
And all her people's brain is but her brain;<br />
And all her history (less her shame)<br />
Is part of her requickened consciousness.<br />
Her courage rises clean again;<br />
Her children's inspiration is her name, her name!<br />
<br />
Even in victory there hides defeat;<br />
The spirit's murdered though the body survives,<br />
Except the cause for which a people strives<br />
Burn with no covetous, foul heat;<br />
Fights she against herself who infamously draws<br />
The sword against man's secret spiritual laws.<br />
But thou, England, because a bitter heel<br />
Hath sought to bruise the brain, the sensitive will,<br />
The conscience of the world,<br />
For this, England, art risen, and shalt fight<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Purely through long profoundest night,<br />
Making their quarrel thine who are grieved like thee;<br />
And (if to thee the stars yield victory)<br />
Tempering their hate of the great foe, that hurled<br />
Vainly her strength against the conscience of the world,<br />
Though all their dead be countless as the stars,<br />
And all the living bitter as the sea.<br />
<br />
I looked again, or dreamed I looked, and saw<br />
The stars again and all their peace again.<br />
The moving mist had gone, and shining still<br />
The moon went high and pale above the hill.<br />
Not now those lights were trembling in the vast<br />
Ways of the nervy heaven, nor trembled earth:<br />
Profound and calm they gazed as the soft-shod hours passed.<br />
And with less fear (not with less awe,<br />
Remembering, England, all the blood and pain),<br />
How look, I cried, ye stern and solitary stars<br />
On these disastrous wars!<br />

<h2>COMMANDEERED</h2>


<p>
Last year he drew the harvest home<br />
Along the winding upland lane;<br />
The children twisted marigolds<br />
And clover flowers, to deck his mane.<br />
Last year&mdash;he drew the harvest home!<br />
<br />
To-day&mdash;with puzzled, patient face,<br />
With ears a-droop, and weary feet,<br />
He marches to the sound of drums,<br />
And draws the gun along the street.<br />
To-day&mdash;he draws the guns of war!<br />

<h2>THE MAN WHO KEEPS HIS HEAD</h2>


<p>
There's a man who fights for England, and he'll keep her still atop,<br />
He will guard her from dishonour in the market and the shop,<br />
He will save her homes from terror on the fields of Daily Bread,<br />
He's the man who sticks to business, he's the man who keeps his head.<br />
<br />
Let the foe who strikes at England hear her wheels of commerce turn,<br />
Let the ships that war with England see her factory furnace burn;<br />
For the foe most fears the cannon, and his heart most quails with dread<br />
When behind the man in khaki is the man who keeps his head.<br />
<br />
Brand him traitor and assassin who with miser's coward mood<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>Has his gold locked up in secret and his larders stored with food,<br />
Who has cast adrift his workers, who lies sweating in his bed,<br />
And who snarls to hear the laughter of the man who keeps his head.<br />
<br />
Let the poor man teach the rich man, for the poor man's constant strife<br />
Is from day to day to seek work, day by day to war with life,<br />
And the poor man's home hangs ever by a frail and brittle thread,<br />
And the poor man's often hungry, but the poor man keeps his head.<br />
<br />
When the ships come back from slaughter, and the troops march home from war;<br />
When the havoc strewn behind us threats the road that lies before,<br />
Every hero shall be welcomed, every orphan shall be fed,<br />
By the man who stuck to business, by the man who kept his head.<br />

<h2>FRANCE</h2>


<p>
Because for once the sword broke in her hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The words she spoke seemed perished for a space;</span><br />
All wrong was brazen, and in every land<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tyrants walked abroad with naked face.</span><br />
<br />
The waters turned to blood, as rose the Star<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of evil fate denying all release.</span><br />
The rulers smote the feeble crying "War!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The usurers robbed the naked crying "Peace!"</span><br />
<br />
And her own feet were caught in nets of gold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her own soul profaned by sects that squirm,</span><br />
And little men climbed her high seats and sold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her honour to the vulture and the worm.</span><br />
<br />
And she seemed broken and they thought her dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Over-Men, so brave against the weak.</span><br />
Has your last word of sophistry been said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O cult of slaves? Then it is hers to speak.</span><br />
<br />
Clear the slow mists from her half-darkened eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As slow mists parted over Valmy fell,</span><br />
And once again her hands in high surprise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take hold upon the battlements of Hell.</span><br />

<h2>WE WILLED IT NOT</h2>


<p>
We willed it not. We have not lived in hate,<br />
Loving too well the shires of England thrown<br />
From sea to sea to covet your estate,<br />
Or wish one flight of fortune from your throne.<br />
<br />
We had grown proud because the nations stood<br />
Hoping together against the calumny<br />
That, tortured of its old barbarian blood,<br />
Barbarian still the heart of man should be.<br />
<br />
Builders there are who name you overlord,<br />
Building with us the citadels of light,<br />
Who hold as we this chartered sin abhorred,<br />
And cry you risen Cæsar of the Night.<br />
<br />
Beethoven speaks with Milton on this day,<br />
And Shakespeare's word with Goethe's beats the sky,<br />
In witness of the birthright you betray,<br />
In witness of the vision you deny.<br />
<br />
We love the hearth, the quiet hills, the song,<br />
The friendly gossip come from every land;<br />
And very peace were now a nameless wrong,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>You thrust this bitter quarrel to our hand.<br />
<br />
For this your pride the tragic armies go,<br />
And the grim navies watch along the seas;<br />
You trade in death, you mock at life, you throw<br />
To God the tumult of your blasphemies.<br />
<br />
You rob us of our love-right. It is said.<br />
In treason to the world you are enthroned.<br />
We rise, and, by the yet ungathered dead,<br />
Not lightly shall the treason be atoned.<br />

<h2>PRO PATRIA</h2>


<p>
England, in this great fight to which you go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because, where Honour calls you, go you must,</span><br />
Be glad, whatever comes, at least to know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">You have your quarrel just.</span><br />
<br />
Peace was your care; before the nations' bar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her cause you pleaded and her ends you sought;</span><br />
But not for her sake, being what you are,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Could you be bribed and bought.</span><br />
<br />
Others may spurn the pledge of land to land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May with the brute sword stain a gallant past;</span><br />
But by the seal to which <i>you</i> set your hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thank God, you still stand fast!</span><br />
<br />
Forth, then, to front that peril of the deep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With smiling lips and in your eyes the light,</span><br />
Stedfast and confident, of those who keep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Their storied scutcheon bright.</span><br />
<br />
And we, whose burden is to watch and wait&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">High-hearted ever, strong in faith and prayer,</span><br />
We ask what offering we may consecrate,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4em;">What humble service share.</span><br />
<br />
To steel our souls against the lust of ease;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To find our welfare in the general good;</span><br />
To hold together, merging all degrees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In one wide brotherhood;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
To teach that he who saves himself is lost;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bear in silence though our hearts may bleed;</span><br />
To spend ourselves, and never count the cost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For others' greater need;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
To go our quiet ways, subdued and sane;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hush all vulgar clamour of the street;</span><br />
With level calm to face alike the strain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Of triumph or defeat;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
This be our part, for so we serve you best,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So best confirm their prowess and their pride,</span><br />
Your warrior sons, to whom in this high test<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Our fortunes we confide.</span><br />

High lust and froward bearing,<br />

Deaf ear and soul uncaring,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fool that passed Thee by,</span><br />
Our times are known before Thee&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lord, grant us strength to die!</span><br />
<br />
From panic, pride, and terror,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Revenge that knows no rein,</span><br />
Light haste and lawless error,<br />

Cloak Thou our undeserving,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make firm the shuddering breath,</span><br />
In silence and unswerving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To taste Thy lesser death!</span><br />
<br />
Ah! Mary, pierced with sorrow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remember, reach and save</span><br />
The soul that comes to-morrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before the God that gave;</span><br />
Since each was born of woman,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For each at utter need&mdash;</span><br />
True comrade and true foeman&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Madonna, intercede!</span><br />
<br />
E'en now their vanguard gathers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">E'en now we face the fray&mdash;</span><br />
As Thou didst help our fathers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Help Thou our host to-day!</span><br />
Fulfilled of signs and wonders,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In life, in death made clear&mdash;</span><br />

<h2>A SUGGESTION</h2>


<p>Those who cannot fight for
their country can help in
quieter ways. One way is to
collect money for the Prince of
Wales' National Relief Fund.</p>

<p>Every purchaser of this book
is, in a real sense, a subscriber to
the Fund, but his duty does not
end there. Let him make it his
business to see that at least twelve
of his friends buy the book too.</p>

<p>That would be really <i>doing
something</i>!</p>
